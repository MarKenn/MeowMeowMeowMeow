## What was I made for

This is a simple iOS app to showcase some basic skills in native iOS development. 

## Description

The core functionality  of the app is to present a random image of a cat along with a random cat fact. Each subsequent tap on the screen will generate a new random image and a new cat fact.

## Additional Features

### First tab - WildCat

 - Contains the basic functions of randomizing a fact and an image of a cat.
 - Added a domesticate button at the top to save the shown fact and image locally

### Second tab - DomesticatedCat

 - Also has the basic function of randomizing a fact and an image of a cat.
 - No network requests to the APIs. Facts and images on the DomesticatedCat tab are fetched from the local storage which is populated using the domesticate button on the WildCat tab.
 - Has a set free button at the top to release the currently shown fact and image into the wild.
